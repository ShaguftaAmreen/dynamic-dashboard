# Dynamic Dashboard Application

This project is a dynamic dashboard built with React and Redux, allowing users to manage multiple dashboards and widgets. Users can add, remove, and search widgets within various categories.

## Features

- **Dynamic Categories and Widgets**: The dashboard is built dynamically from a JSON structure. Categories contain multiple widgets that can be added or removed by the user.
- **Widget Management**: Users can add new widgets by providing a name and text. Widgets can also be removed from any category.
- **Search Functionality**: A search bar allows users to filter widgets by name across all categories.
- **State Management with Redux**: The app uses Redux for managing the state of categories and widgets.
